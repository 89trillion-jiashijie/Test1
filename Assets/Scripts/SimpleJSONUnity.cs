/* * * * *
 * 
 * Unity extension for the SimpleJSON framework. It does only work together with
 * the SimpleJSON.cs
 * It provides several helpers and conversion operators to serialize/deserialize
 * common Unity types such as Vector2/3/4, Rect, RectOffset, Quaternion and
 * Matrix4x4 as JSONObject or JSONArray.
 * This extension will add 3 static settings to the JSONNode class:
 * ( VectorContainerType, QuaternionContainerType, RectContainerType ) which
 * control what node type should be used for serializing the given type. So a
 * Vector3 as array would look like [12,32,24] and {"x":12, "y":32, "z":24} as
 * object.
